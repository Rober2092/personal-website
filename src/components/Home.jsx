          I’m full-stack web developer specializing in building (and occasionally
          designing) exceptional digital experiences. Currently, I’m focused on
          building responsive full-stack web applications.

I have spent the last 10 years in the healthcare field working as a perinatal technician at UCLA health system.I have always had a
knack for
technology and working with computers. In 2021 I started
working
with HTML and CSS to make some minor edits on a small
business website
that I was operating. What I thought was just a few small edits turned into a love for programming.
